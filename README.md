# Fractal Presents

Fractal presents allows you to generate last minute presents using Processing. It's a quick and very dirty code to generate something that looks unique, and shows off your programming skills.

To use this code, you'll need to download Processing, run it, and then click Sketch -> Add File. You'll add your image which has to be **square** and **larger than 1296 pixels**.

The code will spit out an image named present.jpg in the project folder. You can then transform and rotate it to make the complete picture as you like in your favorite image editor.

That being said, the code is ugly and terrible. Your image needs to be **square** and **larger than 1296** pixels. I wrote something in a few minutes Christmas Eve, and don't have the time to rewrite it properly. Instead of complaining, just send me the code fixed.

Oh, and Merry Christmas!
